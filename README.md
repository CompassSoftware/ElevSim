This is a "green field" Java project; that is, there is no initial code base. PO wants
a basic, text-based elevator simulation to explore various elevator system parameters 
(such as, multiple cars, varying numbers of floors, express cars, timing adjustments, 
etc.). There are a number of expected enhancements that will emerge as project 
progresses.
